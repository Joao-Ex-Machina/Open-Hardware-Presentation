# Introduction

- Define Open-source hardware

# Introduction-Timeline

- Give small historic contextualization

# Introductrion-Licenses 

- Hit some licenses here like the OHL etc. be fast we want to go to the eng. meat

# Reasons for Open Hardware

# Open Hardware Projects

We can split open hardware projects into five main groups:

- Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs)
- Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
- FPGAs
- Embedded Systems
- Single-Board computers
(ver mais, h√° mais prolly)

# Open ISAs

Talk about AVR and the other Berkley ISAs up until RISC-V.

# Systems-on-Chip

VexRISC-V for example. Full processors for implementation into FPGAs or silicon


# FPGAs
ICeStorm, ICe40 board.

# Embedded Systems
 Arduino

#Single-Board Computers
VisionFive
