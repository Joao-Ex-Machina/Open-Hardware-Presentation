# Introduction

Free (as in Freedom)/Open-source Hardware are Hardware directives or designs that can be freely: 

- Used
- Studied
- Shared
- Improved

FO-S Hardware can be observed in many variations such as:

- Electronics (the focus of this talk)
- Mechatronics (3D printers, Prosthethics, etc.)
- And many other

# Introductrion-Timeline and Licenses 

- Hit some licenses here like the OHL etc. be fast we want to go to the eng. meat

# Why Free/Open Hardware?

From the researcher standpoint:

- More tools available
    - Adaptable
    - 
- 
- 

From the adept/costumer standpoint:

- Transparency and Respect for the user
- Reparability
- Upgradability

# Open Hardware Projects

We can split open hardware projects into five main groups:

- Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs)
- Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
- Micro-controllers
- Embedded Systems
- Single-Board computers
- FPGAs

# Open ISAs

Talk about AVR and the other Berkley ISAs up until RISC-V.

# Systems-on-Chip

VexRISC-V for example. Full processors for implementation into FPGAs or silicon

# Embedded Systems

Pinecil

# Micro-controllers

Arduino

# Single-Board Computers

VisionFive

# FPGAs 

ICeStorm, ICe40 board.
